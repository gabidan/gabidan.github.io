## Analysis of age  

**Below graph shows the distribution of the passengers' age**

*Approximately half of the passengers were in their 20ties and 30ties*
 
 

 
**The graph below shows the distribution of the age of female passengers who survived**

*Female passengers who survived were mainly in their twenties and thirties, which likely is down to the fact that this age group formed the largest proportion of the passengers*
 
 

 
**The graph below shows the age distrubution of female passengers who died**

*The largest amount of female passegers who died were in their 20ties. Other age groups are distrubed fairly evenly. The smallest amout of dead female passengers were in the 50ties. It is observed that 50% less female passengers in their 20ties and 30ties have died than survived*
  
  

  
**The graph below shows the age distrubution of male passengers who survived**

*There was a significant amount of male toddlers who survived the sinking of the Titanic. Male passengers in their 20ties and 30ties also were the dominating age group. Although there were significantly more men than women on the ship, 50% more female passengers in their 20ties and 30ties have survived. It is considered that male passengers and children were given the priority on the rescue boats*




**The graph below shows the age distrubution of male passengers who died**

*Almost 6 times more male passengers in their 20ties have died than survived. The propotion of survived vs dead male passengers is increasing within a higher age group. It may be considered that elderly passengers may have been given a priority on the survival boats. Also, an assumption coudl be made that elderly passengers were more wealthy and travelled in a higher class where survival chances were higher*
